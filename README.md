# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) - a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event featuring daily programming challenges in December. Each day presents a two-part puzzle that requires creative problem-solving and programming skills.

## Languages Used

- Java
- COBOL

- ## Setup & Compilation

### COBOL Solutions with gnuCOBOL

The COBOL solutions in this repository are compiled and executed using **gnuCOBOL**, a free and open-source COBOL compiler.

#### Installation

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install gnucobol
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install gnu-cobol
```

**Windows:**
Download the installer from [gnuCOBOL official website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnucobol/files/)

#### Compilation

To compile a COBOL program:
```bash
cobc -x -free SourceFilename.cob -o OutputName
```

**Flags used:**
- `-x`: Generate an executable program
- `-free`: Use free-form COBOL syntax

#### Execution

Run the compiled program:
```bash
./OutputName
```

**Note:** Input files for each puzzle should be placed in the same directory as the executable or provide the full path when running the program.

## Approach & Learnings

This repository serves as a platform to:
- Practice Java & COBOL programming
- Solve complex problems under time constraints
- Explore different approaches to the same problem

## Notes

- These solutions demonstrate the versatility of problem-solving across Java and COBOL programming languages.
- Each solution focuses on correctness and clarity rather than extreme optimization.
